									At the time of check-out, a Residence Life representative will go with you to your room with the room file. Your room should be ready 
									for check-out according to the Check-Out Instructions:<br>
									All items must be removed from walls for wall inspection, including posters, pictures, flags, etc. (including your roommate's).<br>
									All trash and unwanted personal items must be removed from the building. Garbage Cans are available outside the building.<br>
									Furniture must not be stacked on other furniture pieces or other objects, including furniture used by your roommate!  The Residence 
									Life Office representative must be able to read inventory numbers of all furniture in the room. A moving charge of 10,000 KRW will be 
									assessed for each piece of stacked furniture.<br>
									The entire room and bathroom must be clean. Cleaning charges may be assessed for sweeping, mopping, bathroom cleaning, or other 
									cleaning.<br>
									All stickers and signs must be removed from doors, windows, and/or furniture. A removal charge of 5,000 KRW will be assessed for per 
									sticker/sign not removed.<br>
									Entrance doors must be free of any drawing/writing.<br>
									Personal items or furniture left in rooms, hallways, or on patios, balconies, and walkways, will be assumed to be abandoned and 
									confiscated by University personnel. A moving charge of 20,000 KRW will be assessed for each piece of non-University furniture, 
									carpeting, or other belongings left in the room.  If you want to keep it, take it with you!<br>
									The furniture (by inventory number) that was in your room at check-in must be in your room at check-out, otherwise you (and your 
									roommate, if also responsible) will be charged for the "Replacement Cost" of each missing piece. No consideration is given to age or 
									condition of the missing furniture; you will be billed the cost of a new piece. You may request a copy of the inventory numbers 
									assigned to your room in order to locate furniture and attempt to reconcile any problems.<br>
									All of your belongings must be out of the room at the time of your check-out. After check-out is complete, you will not have access to 
									the room. The Residence Life Representative will secure the room and be the last to leave the room.

									A close review is made of the cleanliness of the room and cleaning charges are assessed if appropriate. Also, any damage to the room 
									is documented and given to the Residence Life Office so that charges can be assessed. During a regular check-out period, damages are 
									assessed at one-half the charge to each room occupant. If you are checking out at any other time, you will be charged the full amount, 
									unless your roommate provides a written statement taking full responsibility for the damage and giving it to Residence Life. Each 
									student is responsible for cleaning the room and bathroom at the time of check-out. Cleaning charges are not split.
